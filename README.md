# Exploding Tabs
Stop addictive sites from stealing your focus by setting up a countdown timer.

The tab is destroyed when the countdown reaches 0. Default countdown is 3 minutes but you can adjust that for each site. You are notified when 30 seconds remain. To stop the countdown, click the stopwatch icon in the address bar.
